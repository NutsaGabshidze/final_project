        <h2>Welcome to my porfolio page!</h2>

        <p>
          I'm Nutsa, this corner of the internet is where my journey, skills, and creativity come together.

<h3>About Me:</h3>

<p>
I believe in the power of my Beliefs, and I bring that perspective into every project I undertake. An aspiring graphic designer and photographer with a passion for learning. Currently delving into UX/UI design and programming, I aim to blend creativity with functionality. Outside the digital realm, I thrive on hiking adventures, camping trips, and the simple joy of reading books in the metro. Film and music are my constant companions, providing inspiration for my creative pursuits. Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities of design and life together. Feel free to see my artworks.
